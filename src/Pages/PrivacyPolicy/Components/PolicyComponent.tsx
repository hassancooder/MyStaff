            We believe making data more easily available to healthcare workers
            will improve healthcare, but we are also aware that data needs to be
            handled securely and transparently. We believe your organisation
            should own its own data and should have choice about who has access
            to your data or who your organisation consents to view the data.
            Diligram respects the right to privacy and are committed to
            protecting information. This privacy policy explains how we collect,

            HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We place great importance on the security of all PII associated with
            our users. We have security measures in place to attempt to protect
            against the loss, misuse and alteration of personal information
            under our control.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Diligram is designed with stringent security protocols. It uses
            state-of-the art electronic surveillance and multi-factor access
            control systems. All data transport between your app and our servers
            is encrypted.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We use a risk management process based on a HIPAA template. It
            allows us to conduct an accurate and thorough assessment of the
            potential risks and vulnerabilities to the confidentiality,
            integrity, and availability of electronic protected health
            information held by Diligram, and also implement security measures
            sufficient to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to a reasonable and
            appropriate level to comply with HIPAA standards.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            However, with any electronic transmission and storage of data comes
            risks and we cannot guarantee that our databases, or those of our
            third-party affiliates, will be 100% secure. There is also a risk of
            data being intercepted while being transferred over the internet. If
            there is a personal data breach, our data protection officer will
            report it to the competent Supervisory Authority without undue delay
            (not less than 72 hours after becoming aware of it). If a personal
            data breach is likely to result in a high risk to your rights and
            freedom, our Data Protection Officer will communicate the breach to
            you without delay.

            Diligram takes security very seriously and is governed by its

              We are obligated under the GDPR to provide any requested

            Modern Slavery and Human Trafficking Statement
          </h2>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">INTRODUCTION</h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            This statement sets out Diligram's actions to understand all
            potential modern slavery risks related to its business and to put in
            place steps that are aimed at ensuring that there is no slavery or
            human trafficking in its own business and its supply chains.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Diligram recognises that it has a responsibility under the Modern
            Slavery Act 2015 to take a robust approach to slavery and human
            trafficking and is committed to preventing slavery and human
            trafficking in its corporate activities, and to ensuring that its
            supply chains are free from slavery and human trafficking.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">
            OUR BUSINESS AND SUPPLY CHAINS
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Diligram provides a digital quality management software platform for
            NHS and other healthcare organisations, to support their management
            of care quality, patient safety and compliance processes. We operate
            in the UK. This statement applies to employees at all levels
            including directors as well as contractors.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Our supply chains comprise mainly human resources who perform
            skilled services or third-party suppliers who provide software
            development services. However, as a software company, Diligram does
            not have an extensive range of suppliers where modern slavery or
            human trafficking would generally be a material risk, and our supply
            chains are based in low risk countries where modern forms of slavery
            are not prevalent.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">
            RELEVANT DOCUMENTATION
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Diligram operates the following policies that describe its approach
            to the identification of modern slavery risks and steps to be taken
            to prevent slavery and human trafficking in its operations. Our
            policies are clearly defined and communicated to all employees and
            contractors.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">DIGNITY AT WORK</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            We have a zero-tolerance approach to any victimisation, bullying or
            harassment either in the workplace or any work-related setting.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">WHISTLEBLOWING POLICY</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Diligram encourages all its workers, customers and other business
            partners to report any concerns related to the direct activities, or
            the supply chains of Diligram. This includes any circumstances that
            may give rise to an enhanced risk of slavery or human trafficking.
            Diligram's whistleblowing procedure is designed to make it easy for
            workers to make disclosures, without fear of retaliation.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">RECRUITMENT</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Presently, Diligram predominantly carries out its recruitment
            processes in-house. Where additional recruitment expertise is
            required, Diligram uses only specified, reputable employment
            agencies to source labour and always verifies the practices of any
            new agency it is using before accepting workers from that agency.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">EMPLOYMENT</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            All our employees are treated fairly and equally and are paid at
            least the national minimum wage. Our employees will not be forced to
            work more than the number of hours permitted in law, and normal
            working hours will not exceed 48 hours per week average unless the
            employee expressly agrees.
          </p>

          <h4 className="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">DUE DILIGENCE</h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The organisation undertakes due diligence when considering taking on
            new suppliers, and regularly reviews its existing suppliers. The
            organisation's due diligence and reviews include:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
            <li>
              Evaluating the modern slavery and human trafficking risks of each
              new supplier;
            </li>
            <li>
              Reviewing on a regular basis all aspects of the supply chain based
              on the supply chain mapping;
            </li>
            <li>Conducting supplier audits should this be deemed prudent;</li>
          </ul>

          <h4 className="font-semibold mt-4 mb-2">
            AWARENESS-RAISING PROGRAMME
          </h4>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Diligram will raise awareness of modern slavery issues by
            circulating information relating to modern slavery and human
            trafficking to staff in its employee handbook.
